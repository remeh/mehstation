# mehstation


`mehstation` is a multi-launcher frontend fully driven by a gamepad/keyboard.

After having configured your platforms (Native, Emulators, ...) and the executables to launch on these platforms (binary, ROMs, ...), you will  have an interface usable to launch everything using a gamepad controller or a keyboard.

  * Favorite your executables, launch random executables, etc.
  * Automatic detection and visual mapping of gamepads.
  * Sounds (can be disabled in settings)

## Configuration

To configure your mehstation, the easiest solution is to use the dedicated graphical tool shipped with mehstation called [mehstation-config](https://github.com/remeh/mehstation-config). The usage of this configuration tool is documented in the [mehstation wiki](https://github.com/remeh/mehstation/wiki).

However, the configuration sometimes need to be done in command-line. This is why there is also [mehtadata](https://github.com/remeh/mehtadata), a configuration and scraping command-line tool .
