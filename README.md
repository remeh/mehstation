# mehstation


`mehstation` is a multi-launcher frontend fully driven by a gamepad/keyboard.

After having configured your platforms (Native, Emulators, ...) and the executables to launch on these platforms (binary, ROMs, ...), you will  have an interface usable to launch everything using a gamepad controller or a keyboard.
